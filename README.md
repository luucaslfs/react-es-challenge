# Pokemon React App

## Description

This project is a simple React application built for a Software Engineering mentoring challenge as part of the Information Systems B.Sc. program in UFPE. The app allows users to search for Pokemon details and view their names, types, and sprite images. It utilizes the PokeAPI (pokeapi.co) to fetch Pokemon data.
